    <p>States<br>
        The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties
        that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds
        some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. For example, let us think of the clock that
        we created in this article, we were calling the render() method every second explicitly, but React provides a
        better way to achieve the same result and that is by using State, storing the value of time as a member of the
        component’s state. We will look into this more elaborately later in the article.</p>

    <p>State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current
        situation. It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).</p>
    <p>What are the differences between props and state?
        Finally, let’s recap and see the main differences between props and state:

        Components receive data from outside with props, whereas they can create and manage their own data with state
        Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data
        Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a component that is receiving it from outside
        State data can be modified by its own component, but is private (cannot be accessed from outside)
        Props can only be passed from parent component to child (unidirectional flow)
        Modifying state should happen with the setState ( ) method</p>


        <p>lass Clock extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
              super(props);
              this.state = {date: new Date()};
            }
          
            render() {
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
                  <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
                </div>
              );
            }
          }</p>
          <p>state jo value initailize krta hai component ko usko hm contructor method k andar likht hai</p>
